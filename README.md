History
==================

A machine learning package, eventually to be a repository of several frameworks and classes, for now contains a limited selection of implemented frameworks.

* Currently implemented

>* Genetic algorithm framework

>* Markov chain implementation

>* code examples

* Intended Future Components

>* Neural Net framework

>* Bayesian classification

These classes depend on <a href="https://github.com/polygonal/ds">the polygonal labs datastructures</a> project

These frameworks are intended to be easily extended and integrated into other projects.

Contributions from other developers are welcome.
